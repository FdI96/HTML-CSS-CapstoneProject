**This Page is my first capstone project for Microverse**

# Getting started :

I'm very excited to say that this is my first CapStone project for Microverse, about HTML and CSS. To be honest I really enjoyed
working on this project. I used all of my knowledge from the past weeks to make this since semantics tags to pseudo-selectors, gradients, responsive tecnhique, flexbox, grid, bootstrap, linking different pages and work by myself!

The purpose of this project is to create a similar looking webpage like the "client" ask for. In this case the honorables TSE are my "client".

So I had to clone the layout and desing from the screenshots that I received using everything that I learned from the HTML&CSS module.
